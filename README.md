# SqueakPeek

## A Capstone/Senior Design Project at CSULB

We are a dedicated team of college students who understood firsthand the challenges of job searching and building professional connections. Thatâ€™s why, in 2024, we began development on SqueakPeek to allow you to connect with other job applicants, share experiences, and track your progress every step of the way. Through message threads, you can communicate about specific opportunities, discuss interview insights, and feel more informed as you move forward in your career.
